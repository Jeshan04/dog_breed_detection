# Dog Breed Detection

This project is a simple web application for predicting the breed of a dog from an uploaded image. It utilizes a deep learning model trained on a dataset of various dog breeds.

## Features

- Upload an image of a dog
- Predict the breed of the dog using a pre-trained deep learning model
- Supports common image formats like PNG, JPG, and JPEG

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- Keras

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/Jeshan04/dog_breed_detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd dog_breed_detection
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

2. Upload an image of a dog using the file uploader.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to predict the breed of the dog.

## Model

The deep learning model used for dog breed prediction is trained on a dataset containing images of various dog breeds. The model architecture is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
